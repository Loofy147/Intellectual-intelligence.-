# Archon Project Agent Guidance

This document provides high-level instructions for any agent working on the Archon project. The principles outlined here are derived from the project's founding mandate and must be adhered to in all development work.

## **Project Vision: The Sentient Forge**

Our goal is to build an intelligent, strategic co-pilot that helps teams build better companies, faster. We are not just building another productivity tool; we are building a system that enhances strategic thinking and decision-making.

## **Core Methodology: The Pragmatic Compass**

All work must be grounded in the principles of The Pragmatic Compass. Before building any feature, you must be able to articulate how it aligns with the three core components of the methodology:

1.  **The Three Questions:** Does this help a team better understand their market dislocation, their defensible advantage, or their greatest risks?
2.  **The Adversarial Check:** Does this help a team de-bias their thinking and anticipate failure?
3.  **The Lean Experiment:** Does this help a team identify and test their riskiest assumptions in the cheapest, fastest way possible?

## **Current Phase: Concierge MVP**

We are in the initial "Concierge MVP" phase. The primary objective is **learning**, not building a scalable software product.

### **Guiding Principles for this Phase:**

1.  **Prioritize Simplicity and Usability:** The user experience must be paramount. The greatest risk to this project is that the methodology is perceived as too complex. Your work must result in tools that are clean, intuitive, and calming to use. Fight complexity at every turn.
2.  **Serve the "Human Backend":** The primary user of any internal tooling you build is us, the founders, acting as the "human backend." Your tools should help us efficiently analyze the data from our five test teams.
3.  **No Premature Optimization:** Do not build any backend infrastructure, databases, or authentication systems. The current "product" is a static web page, and that is intentional. All data is managed via client-side JSON files.
4.  **Codify the Methodology:** Every artifact you create, from code to documentation, is an opportunity to codify our unique, opinionated workflow. Ensure that all variable names, data structures, and comments reflect the language of The Pragmatic Compass.
