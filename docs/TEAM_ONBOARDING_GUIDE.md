# **Welcome to The Pragmatic Compass Program!**

We are thrilled to have you on board. Over the next six weeks, we will work together to bring a new level of clarity, focus, and velocity to your strategic planning. This guide will walk you through what to expect and how to get the most out of our time together.

### **The Goal: A System for Better Decisions**

Our objective is to help you install a durable, repeatable process for making high-quality strategic decisions. By the end of this program, you will have a clear, documented strategy and a framework for continuously testing and improving it.

### **The Tool: The Pragmatic Compass Template**

The core of our work will be structured around the Pragmatic Compass, a simple web-based template designed to guide your thinking.

**How to Use the Tool:**

1.  **Access:** You can find the tool here: [Link to the live `index.html` file]. We recommend bookmarking this link.
2.  **Filling it out:** The template is divided into three sections: "The Three Questions," "The Adversarial Check," and "The Lean Experiment." We will work through these sections together during our weekly sessions.
3.  **Saving Your Work:** The tool is fully client-side, meaning your data is always private to you. To save your progress, click the **"Save as JSON"** button. This will download a `pragmatic-compass.json` file to your computer.
4.  **Loading Your Work:** Before each session, you can load your previous work by opening the tool and using the **"Load from JSON"** button to select your saved file. We recommend keeping a single, version-controlled copy of this file that your team can share.

### **The Process: Weekly Facilitated Sessions**

Our engagement is structured around a weekly 60-minute facilitated session.

**What to Expect:**

*   **Our Role:** We are facilitators and strategic sounding boards. We will ask hard questions, guide the discussion, and ensure that your decisions are captured in a structured way using the Compass tool.
*   **Your Role:** Your role is to be open, honest, and engaged. The more transparent you are about your challenges and assumptions, the more value you will get from this process.

**Typical Agenda:**

*   **Weeks 1-2: Foundations.** We will focus on filling out the initial version of your Pragmatic Compass, focusing on "The Three Questions" and "The Adversarial Check."
*   **Weeks 3-5: The Lean Experiment.** We will shift our focus to identifying your riskiest assumptions and designing cheap, fast experiments to test them.
*   **Week 6: Handoff and Reflection.** We will review your completed Compass, reflect on the process, and ensure you are equipped to continue using the framework independently.

### **Next Steps**

Before our first session, please:

1.  Familiarize yourself with the Pragmatic Compass tool.
2.  Designate one person on your team to be the "owner" of your `pragmatic-compass.json` file.
3.  Come prepared to discuss the "Three Questions" at a high level.

We are incredibly excited to begin this journey with you. Let's get to work.
