# **Partner with Us to Build a Better Strategy, Faster. For Free.**

**Are you an early-stage startup founder or product leader wrestling with strategic uncertainty? Do you have a clear vision but a messy roadmap? We can help.**

We are strategy and systems experts developing a new framework for strategic clarity called **The Pragmatic Compass**. We are looking for five ambitious teams to partner with for an exclusive, 6-week strategy acceleration program.

---

### **The Problem: The "Strategic Void"**

The modern software stack is great for executing work (`Jira`, `Slack`), but it fails to provide a system of record for making wise decisions. Strategy lives in scattered documents, gut feelings, and endless meetings. This chaos leads to wasted effort, slow learning, and expensive mistakes.

### **The Offer: A 6-Week Strategic Co-Pilot Program (Free)**

We are offering a completely free, hands-on program where we will personally facilitate your weekly strategy and product meetings. We will act as your dedicated strategic co-pilots, helping you install a powerful, structured decision-making process at the core of your company.

**What You Will Get:**

*   **Clarity:** A clear, documented, and rigorous articulation of your strategy.
*   **Alignment:** A shared understanding across your team of your goals, risks, and priorities.
*   **Velocity:** A repeatable process for identifying and testing your riskiest assumptions, enabling you to learn and adapt faster.
*   **Tools:** Access to our proprietary "Pragmatic Compass" template to structure your thinking.

### **Who We're Looking For**

We are seeking **five** early-stage startup teams who are:

*   Post-launch and pre-product-market fit.
*   Actively grappling with "what's next" on their roadmap.
*   Willing to be open and transparent in a confidential setting.
*   Committed to adopting a more structured approach to strategy.

### **Your Commitment**

Your only cost is your time. We require:

*   Commitment from the core leadership/product team.
*   Participation in one 60-minute facilitated strategy session per week for 6 weeks.
*   A willingness to use our template and provide honest feedback on the process.

### **Interested?**

If you are ready to move beyond chaotic strategy and build a more deliberate, resilient company, we want to talk to you.

**To apply, please contact us at [Founder Email] with a brief description of your company and the strategic challenges you're facing.**
