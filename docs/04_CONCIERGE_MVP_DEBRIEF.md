# **Debrief: Concierge MVP Experiment (Cohort 1)**

**Date:** 2025-11-10

**Objective:** To analyze the results of the 6-week Concierge MVP experiment and render a "Go / No-Go" verdict on the core hypothesis: *that a founding team will find the Pragmatic Compass methodology valuable enough to voluntarily adopt its structured process.*

---

## **1. Quantitative Analysis: Success Signals**

The experiment was designed with two clear, quantifiable success signals. The results are as follows:

### **1.1. Adoption Signal**
*   **Goal:** At least **3 out of 5** teams voluntarily continue to use the template and process without facilitation.
*   **Result:** **3 out of 5** teams met this criterion (Teams Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie).
*   **Verdict:** **SUCCESS**

### **1.2. Perceived Value Signal**
*   **Goal:** An average score of **8.0 / 10** or higher to the question: "How devastating would it be if you could no longer use this process?"
*   **Result:**
    *   Team Alpha: 9/10
    *   Team Bravo: 10/10
    *   Team Charlie: 8/10
    *   Team Delta: 6/10
    *   Team Echo: 7/10
    *   **Average Score:** (9 + 10 + 8 + 6 + 7) / 5 = **8.0 / 10**
*   **Verdict:** **SUCCESS**

## **2. Qualitative Analysis: Key Learnings & Patterns**

The quantitative signals indicate a clear success, but the qualitative notes reveal critical nuances that must inform our next steps.

### **2.1. Who It's For: The Ideal Customer Profile**

The process resonated most strongly with teams that fit a specific profile:
*   **Problem-focused & Data-driven:** Teams Alpha and Bravo, who are deeply analytical and focused on solving a clear business problem, derived the most value. For them, the Compass was a natural extension of their rigorous mindset.
*   **Mission-driven but Lacking Structure:** Team Charlie represents a key secondary persona. They are passionate and vision-driven, and they valued the Compass as a "dose of discipline" to focus their energy.

### **2.2. Who It's *Not* For (Right Now)**

The process failed to gain adoption with teams that were:
*   **Culturally Opposed to Structure:** Team Delta ("move fast and break things") found the process too slow and "academic." This highlights a clear cultural anti-persona.
*   **Creatively-driven & Emergent:** Team Echo (a creative tool) found the hypothesis-testing framework too rigid for their more discovery-driven workflow.

### **2.3. The "Aha!" Moments: Where the Value Resides**

Across all teams, including those who did not adopt, the value was concentrated in three key areas of the framework:
1.  **The Pre-Mortem & Adversarial Check:** This was consistently the highest-impact exercise, forcing teams to confront uncomfortable truths and de-bias their thinking (Alpha, Charlie).
2.  **The "Riskiest Assumption" Distillation:** The act of boiling down a complex strategy to a single, testable assumption was a moment of profound clarity for most teams (Alpha, Bravo, Delta).
3.  **The Forcing Function of Conciseness:** The simple act of writing things down in a structured way forced a level of clarity and alignment that was missing from their scattered documents and meetings.

## **3. Verdict and Recommendation**

**The core hypothesis is validated.** The data, both quantitative and qualitative, strongly indicates that the Pragmatic Compass methodology provides significant, adoptable value to a specific and identifiable segment of the startup market.

The experiment has successfully de-risked the most critical behavioral-change assumption of the entire venture.

**Recommendation:** **GO.**

We have earned the right to proceed to the next phase. The next riskiest assumption is that the value of this methodology can be delivered *through self-serve software alone*. The recommendation is to immediately begin the "Synthesize -> Build" cycle for the **Productized MVP (Archon V1)**.
