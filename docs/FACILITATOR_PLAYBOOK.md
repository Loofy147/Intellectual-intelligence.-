# **Internal Document: Facilitator's Playbook for the Concierge MVP**

This document is our internal guide to facilitating the 6-week Pragmatic Compass program. Its purpose is to ensure that every team receives the same high-quality, structured experience, which is critical for the validity of our experiment.

### **Core Principles of Facilitation**

*   **We are guides, not consultants.** Our job is not to give answers, but to ask the right questions. We guide the team through the framework and help them structure their own thinking.
*   **Maintain the "Strategic Altitude."** Keep the conversation focused on the "why," not the "how." If the discussion devolves into implementation details, gently steer it back to the core strategic questions.
*   **Be the Scribe.** Your most important tactical role is to accurately capture the team's discussion in their `pragmatic-compass.json` file. The output of each session must be a clear, concise, and mutually-agreed-upon update to their Compass.
*   **Listen more than you talk.** The team's insights are the raw material of this process. Our value is in structuring those insights, not generating them.

### **Week-by-Week Session Guide**

**Session 1: Introduction & The Three Questions**

*   **Objective:** Introduce the process and complete a first pass of "The Three Questions."
*   **Agenda:**
    1.  (10 min) Welcome, introductions, and overview of the 6-week program. Reiterate the goal: installing a process, not just creating a document.
    2.  (15 min) **Question 1: Market Dislocation.** Ask open-ended questions like: "What's the non-obvious change in the world that creates the opportunity for you?" or "What's the 'before and after' story for your customer?"
    3.  (15 min) **Question 2: Asymmetric Advantage.** Ask: "If you succeed, what will be the one thing that another company can't just copy?" or "What's the system you're building that gets stronger with every new user?"
    4.  (15 min) **Question 3: GTM Risk.** Ask: "What is the single biggest reason this might not work, assuming the technology is perfect?" or "What's the core human behavior you have to change?"
    5.  (5 min) Wrap-up. Explain that you will clean up their answers in the Compass and send it to them.

**Session 2: The Adversarial Check & Refining the Questions**

*   **Objective:** Complete a first pass of "The Adversarial Check" and refine the initial answers to "The Three Questions."
*   **Agenda:**
    1.  (10 min) Review the updated Compass from last week. Ask for any immediate refinements or corrections.
    2.  (20 min) **Pre-Mortem Headline.** Frame the exercise: "It's a year from now, and this has failed. What's the headline in the tech press?" Encourage brutal honesty.
    3.  (20 min) **Kill Strategy.** Discuss both platform and incumbent threats. Ask: "How could Jira make a 'good enough' version of this?" and "How could your closest competitor pivot to kill you?"
    4.  (10 min) Revisit "The Three Questions" based on the adversarial discussion. Do the risks identified change the view of the moat?

**Session 3: The Lean Experiment - Identifying the Riskiest Assumption**

*   **Objective:** Identify the single riskiest assumption underpinning their entire strategy. This is often the hardest and most important session.
*   **Agenda:**
    1.  (15 min) Review the full Compass. The goal is to find the "leap of faith."
    2.  (40 min) Brainstorm assumptions. Ask: "What belief, if proven wrong, would cause this entire plan to fall apart?" List all of them. Then, force-rank them. The riskiest assumption is the one that is both highly consequential and highly uncertain.
    3.  (5 min) Solidify the wording of the chosen assumption.

**Session 4: Designing the Experiment**

*   **Objective:** Design the cheapest, fastest, and most effective experiment to test the riskiest assumption.
*   **Agenda:**
    1.  (10 min) Re-state the riskiest assumption.
    2.  (40 min) Brainstorm experiment ideas. Emphasize speed and cost. Ask: "How could we get a signal on this in the next two weeks with less than $100?" or "What is the 'non-scalable' thing we could do to test this?" This is where a Concierge MVP is often born.
    3.  (10 min) Define the experiment and the quantifiable success signal. What specific number will prove or disprove the assumption?

**Session 5: Running the Experiment & Reviewing Results**

*   **Objective:** This session is flexible, depending on the experiment the team is running. It could be a check-in, a review of early results, or a planning session for the next iteration.
*   **Agenda:**
    1.  (15 min) Status update on the experiment.
    2.  (30 min) Deep dive into any data or qualitative feedback that has been collected.
    3.  (15 min) Decide on next steps. Does the experiment need to continue, or is there enough data to draw a conclusion?

**Session 6: Handoff, Reflection, and The "Superhuman" Question**

*   **Objective:** Conclude the formal engagement, ensure the team is comfortable continuing the process on their own, and gather our key success signal.
*   **Agenda:**
    1.  (20 min) Review the entire Pragmatic Compass. It should now be a clear and powerful artifact.
    2.  (20 min) Reflect on the 6-week process. What worked? What didn't? How can they integrate this into their weekly cadence?
    3.  (15 min) **Ask the key question:** "On a scale of 1-10, how devastating would it be if you could no longer use this process?" Record the answer verbatim.
    4.  (5 min) Thank them for their participation and officially conclude the program.
