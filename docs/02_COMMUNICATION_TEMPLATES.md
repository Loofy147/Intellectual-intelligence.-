## **Template 1: Initial Recruitment Outreach (Email)**

**Subject: A free, hands-on co-pilot for your product strategy**

Hi [Founder Name],

I'm reaching out because I'm a strategy and systems expert, and I'm looking for a small number of ambitious, early-stage startups to partner with for an exclusive, 6-week strategy acceleration program, completely free of charge.

In short, I will personally facilitate your weekly product strategy meetings, acting as a dedicated co-pilot to help you install a powerful, structured decision-making process at the core of your company.

I'm developing a new framework called **The Pragmatic Compass** that helps teams move from chaotic, document-driven strategy to a clear, rigorous, and repeatable system for making better decisions, faster.

If you're grappling with "what's next" on your roadmap and are willing to trade your time and feedback for a world-class strategic process, I'd love to tell you more.

Would you be open to a brief 15-minute chat next week to see if this would be a good fit?

Best,

Jules

## **Template 2: Onboarding Welcome (Email)**

**Subject: Welcome to The Pragmatic Compass Program!**

Hi [Team Name],

Welcome! I'm thrilled to have you on board for the 6-week Pragmatic Compass program.

Our goal over the next six weeks is to work together to install a durable, repeatable process for making high-quality strategic decisions at the core of your company.

**Here are your next steps:**

1.  **The Tool:** Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with the Pragmatic Compass template, which we will be using in our sessions. You can access it here: [Link to `app/index.html`]
2.  **How it Works:** The tool is 100% client-side. To save your work, use the "Save as JSON" button. To load it in a future session, use the "Load from JSON" button. Please designate one person as the "owner" of your team's JSON file.
3.  **Our First Session:** I've sent a separate calendar invitation for our first session. We will hit the ground running, so please come prepared to discuss the "Three Questions" at a high level.

I'm incredibly excited to begin this journey with you.

Best,

Jules
