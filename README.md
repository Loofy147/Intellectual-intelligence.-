# **Archon Project (Codename: "The Sentient Forge")**

This repository contains the foundational assets for the Archon project. Our vision is to build an intelligent, strategic co-pilot that helps teams build better companies, faster.

## **Current Phase: Concierge MVP**

We are currently in the **Concierge MVP** phase. The goal of this phase is not to build scalable software, but to test our core riskiest assumption: *that a founding team or product leader will feel enough pain to adopt a new, structured methodology for strategy.*

To test this, we are running a 6-week strategic co-pilot program with five early-stage startups. We, the founders, will act as the "software" to validate the value of our methodology, **The Pragmatic Compass**.

## **Repository Structure**

This repository contains the complete toolkit for running the Concierge MVP experiment.

*   **/ (root)**
    *   `index.html`: The static web-based "Pragmatic Compass" template. This is the core "product" for the experiment.
    *   `style.css`: The stylesheet for the template.
    *   `script.js`: The client-side logic for the template, including the "Save/Load as JSON" functionality.
    *   `analyze_compass.py`: A Python script for the "human backend" (us) to analyze the JSON files generated by the teams.
    *   `EXPERIMENT_TRACKING.md`: The system of record for tracking the progress and success signals of the experiment.
    *   `AGENTS.md`: High-level guidance for any agent (human or AI) working on this project.

*   **/docs**
    *   `FOUNDING_MANDATE.md`: The original, version-controlled strategic mandate for the Archon project.
    *   `RECRUITMENT_BRIEF.md`: The one-pager used to recruit teams into our program.
    *   `TEAM_ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md`: The guide provided to teams once they are accepted.
    *   `FACILITATOR_PLAYBOOK.md`: Our internal, week-by-week guide to running the facilitation sessions.

## **Next Steps**

The "Build" phase for the Concierge MVP is now **complete**.

The immediate next step is to move into the "Execute" phase:

1.  **Recruit five startup teams** using the `RECRUITMENT_BRIEF.md`.
2.  **Onboard the selected teams** using the `TEAM_ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md`.
3.  **Run the 6-week program** using the `FACILITATOR_PLAYBOOK.md`.
4.  **Rigorously track the results** in `EXPERIMENT_TRACKING.md`.

This experiment will provide the foundational data needed to make the decision on whether to proceed with building the full software product.
