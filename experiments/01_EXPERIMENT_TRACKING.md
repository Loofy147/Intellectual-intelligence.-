# Concierge MVP Experiment Tracking - Cohort 1

This document tracks the progress and results of the Concierge MVP experiment.

## **Success Signals**

*   **Adoption:** At least **3 of 5** teams voluntarily continue to use the template without our facilitation.
*   **Perceived Value:** Average score of **8/10 or higher**.

---

## **Weekly Notes & Observations**

### **Team Alpha (CarbonCapture AI)**
*   **Week 1:** Highly technical team. Struggled to articulate "GTM Risk" beyond funding.
*   **Week 2:** Breakthrough on "Pre-Mortem": "Regulators Deem AI 'Black Box' Unauditable." Forced a focus on transparency.
*   **Week 3:** Identified riskiest assumption: "Companies will pay a premium for a high-accuracy, black-box model over a simpler, auditable one."
*   **Week 4:** Designed a landing page test comparing "99% Accuracy" vs. "Fully Auditable & Transparent" messaging.
*   **Week 5:** Experiment results: "Auditable" messaging had a 3x higher conversion rate for demo requests. Major pivot point.
*   **Week 6:** Team energized. Now using the Compass as their weekly product strategy agenda. Rigor of the process appeals to their scientific background.

---
### **Team Bravo (FinScribe)**
*   **Week 1:** Very organized. Framework forced conciseness.
*   **Week 2:** "Kill Strategy" was a huge win. Realized their threat was QuickBooks launching a "good enough" feature, reframing their moat discussion.
*   **Week 3:** Riskiest assumption: "SMBs are willing to switch financial tools for better reporting, even if it means migrating data."
*   **Week 4:** Designed a "Concierge" experiment, manually migrating 10 new customers for free.
*   **Week 5:** Migration pain was higher than expected, but post-migration customers were extremely sticky.
*   **Week 6:** Decided to build an "automated migration service" as their #1 priority. Maria called the Compass "the brain of our strategy."

---
### **Team Charlie (MedPath)**
*   **Week 1:** Mission-driven team. Struggled to define "Moat" beyond "we care more."
*   **Week 2:** Emotional but productive pre-mortem: "Patients Abandon MedPath Due to 'Data Entry Fatigue'."
*   **Week 3:** Riskiest assumption: "That patients will consistently track their symptoms if the tool is easy to use."
*   **Week 4:** Resisted "quantifiable signal" initially. Designed an SMS-based check-in to measure engagement.
*   **Week 5:** Mixed results. Engagement high in week 1, dropped off in week 2.
*   **Week 6:** Process provided valuable, difficult insights. Rethinking their core engagement loop. They see the Compass as a "dose of discipline."

---
### **Team Delta (GigBridge)**
*   **Week 1-2:** Fast-moving team, initially skeptical of the process, calling it "academic."
*   **Week 3:** "Riskiest Assumption" was a turning point. Realized they had been conflating supply-side and demand-side assumptions.
*   **Week 4:** Designed an experiment to test the supply-side assumption about worker adoption vs. existing networks.
*   **Week 5:** Experiment (signing up workers at a trade store) had lukewarm results. High trust barrier.
*   **Week 6:** Found the experiment valuable but felt the 6-week process was too slow for their culture. Did not continue using the template.

---
### **Team Echo (Lore)**
*   **Week 1:** Highly creative, product-led team. Loved the "Three Questions."
*   **Week 2:** Adversarial checks were less impactful in their nascent market.
*   **Week 3-4:** Struggled to identify a single riskiest assumption, as their process is more emergent discovery.
*   **Week 5:** Designed a clever in-product experiment to test community collaboration, which was highly positive.
*   **Week 6:** Enjoyed the process as a brainstorming tool but found it too rigid for their weekly workflow. Will use it "from time to time to gut-check ourselves."
